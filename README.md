# Regression-Models-on-Predicting-Strikes-in-OECD-Countries
Fall 2016 STAT331 Final Project

## Summary
The goal of this project is to obtain the relation between strikes activity and some macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment rate and inﬂation. In order to achieve this goal, after excluding the dependent variable, we selected two candidate models by applying automated model selection and log transformation. We then provide the models’ diagnostics information including residual plots, leverage and Cook’s distance, so that we can choose the more suitable one. 

We favored one of the models based on the model selection and model diagnostics conducted.The ﬁnal model indicates the necessity of log transformation and the interaction between covariates including the interaction between unemployment rate & inﬂation and inﬂation & trade union density. Moreover, discovered by observing speciﬁc graphs, the model may violate heteroscedasticity assumption and normality assumption.
